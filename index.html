    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
  <div class="card-1">
    <p>At <b>Mayi</b>, we believe that water is more than just a necessity—it's a source of life, health, and community.</p>
    <p>Our journey started with a simple mission: to offer the purest and most refreshing water, while taking care of the environment. <b>Mayi</b>, meaning "water" in Swahili, is a celebration of nature’s most vital resource, and we’re committed to delivering it in its purest form. Based in the heart of Africa, our water undergoes an advanced reverse osmosis process to ensure the highest level of purity. </p>
    <p>We’re also proud to package our water in environmentally friendly bottles, providing both premium hydration and a sustainable solution for a healthier planet.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re sipping still, sparkling, or refilling one of our eco-friendly bottles, you can be assured that <b>Mayi</b> represents the perfect balance between purity and sustainability.
